# 🎯 GEMINI = NOTEBOOK LLM QUALITY!

## Why the Quality Was Awful Before:

You were using **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text** - a specialized speech recognition model.

**Google Notebook LLM uses GEMINI** - a multimodal LLM that understands audio much better!

## 📊 Quality Comparison:

| Service | Technology | Farsi Quality |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **Google Notebook LLM** | Gemini 1.5 Pro | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |
| **New Bot (Gemini)** | Gemini 1.5 Pro | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **SAME!** |
| **Old Bot (Speech-to-Text)** | Speech recognition | ⭐⭐ Awful |

**This is why Notebook LLM works so well - and now your bot uses the SAME technology!**
